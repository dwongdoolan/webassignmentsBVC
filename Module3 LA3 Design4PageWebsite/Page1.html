                        <li><b>Drink more water</b>
                            <p>Water keeps every system in the body functioning
                                properly. It promotes cardiovascular health, contributes to increased
                                athletic performance, reduces joint pain, helps with weight loss, 
                                reduces headaches, balances your blood sugar and cleans toxins from your
                                body and promotes healthy skin.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Eat healthy meals and snacks</b>
                            <p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet is one of the most important things
                                you can do to protect your health. Healthy eating helps us to maintain
                                a healthy weight and reduces our risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood
                                pressure, high cholesterol and the risk of developing cardiovascular
                                disease and some cancers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be physically active</b>
                            <p>Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can
                                do for your health. Being active improves your brain health, weight
                                management, reduces disease, strengthens your bones and muscles and improves
                                your ability to do everyday activities.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Go to bed earlier tonight</b>
                            <p>Good quality sleep reduces the risk of chronic life-threatening diseases. Sufficient
                                sleep has a positive impact on learning and memory, provides more energy, strengthens
                                the immune system, reduces anxiety and depression, sharpens thinking skills and
                                increases productivity.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Take control of your money</b>
                            <p>Money gives you freedom and choices. Get informed, set financial goals, calculate your
                                net worth, create a spending plan/budget, pay down debts, save and invest and
                                understand your taxes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Declutter</b>
                            <p>Decluttering and simplifying are about getting rid of the excess and the distractions
                                so you have more time, space, energy and freedom for what matters most to you.
                                Decluttering your work and living spaces helps your brain focus.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Read more books</b>
                            <p>Reading is like exercise for your brain. Reading books has many benefits, including,
                                growing vocabulary, improving memory, developing stronger analytical thinking skills,
                                improving focus and concentration, in addition to the knowledge gained.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be grateful</b>
                            <p>When we acknowledge what is good in our lives it helps us experience more positive emotions.
                                Gratitude can help you appreciate what you have rather than focusing on what you don't
                                have. It helps you savour good experiences, deal with adversity and build strong 
                                relationships.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Develop stress management techniques</b>
                            <p>Positive stress can help us grow. Negative stress can hold us back, cause anxiety and be
                                perceived as outside of our coping abilities. Effective stress management is important
                                in a balanced life, a tool in developing resilience to thrive under pressure and address 
                                challenges. Think about practicing yoga, meditation or deep breathing exercises.<p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Challenge your mind</b>
                            <p>A healthy brain thrives on challenge, especially challenges that are personally relevant
                                and
                                involve many different parts of the brain at the same time. If you have a challenge it
                                gives
                                a sense of purpose and a sense of accomplishment when you master a task. 
                                Learn something new, volunteer your time and share your knowledge or rediscover a
                                childhood hobby
                                or interest.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Build a strong social network</b>
                            <p>Humans are social creatures, the number and quality of your relationships play a significant
                                role in our mental and emotional health. Relationships with your friends, family and 
                                community can be a great source of support in adversity and foster a sense of connection.
                                The people you spend the most time with affect your behaviours so choose friends with healthy habits!</p>
