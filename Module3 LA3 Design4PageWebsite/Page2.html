                    <h3>PRACTICAL HABITS</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Plan a weekly menu and grocery list</b>
                        <p>It saves you time and money by knowing what you're going to have for dinner
                            and ensuring you'll have the ingredients on hand. It reduces multiple trips to
                            the grocery store, reduces unplanned purchases and reduces food waste by buying
                            what you need.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Cook meals at home</b>
                        <p>You will know what goes into your meals and can control the fat and sodium.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Prepare snacks in advance</b>
                        <p>Cut up vegetables and have them available for adding to lunches or for snacks. Stock
                            a snack section in your pantry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Eat breakfast</b>
                        <p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It boosts your metabolism, provides
                            energy and nutrients, helps stabilize your blood sugars and improves concentration
                            and mood.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Avoid sugary drinks and fruit juice</b>
                        <p>Sugary drinks including energy drinks, fruit drinks, 100% fruit juice, soft drinks
                            and flavored coffees have lots of sugar and little to no nutritional value. Although
                            fruit juice has some of the benefits of the fruit (vitamins, minerals), it has more
                            sugar than the fruit and less fiber. Drink more water, it promotes hydration without
                            calories.</p>
                        </li>    
                        <li><b>Include your kids in picking new vegetables and fruits to try each week</b>
                        <p>Figure out how to cook it or prepare it together. It engages their curiosity and
                            encourages their interest in healthy food choices, food preparation and in consuming it,
                            if you have a selective eater.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Try different cooking methods for vegetables</b>
                        <p>Some kids and some adults respond differently to texture, for example, some kids may
                            prefer roasted cauliflower to raw cauliflower.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Try new recipes</b>
                        <p>Variety is the spice of life and healthy doesn't have to be boring. You can learn about
                            new ingredients or cooking techniques. Look in your existing cookbooks, try online sources
                            or buy some cooking magazines for inspiration.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Remake your favourite recipes</b>
                        <p>One way to get kids engaged in meal planning is to encourage them to request their favourite
                            recipes which often become "Family Classic Recipes" in our home.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Plan for leftovers</b>
                        <p>Try batch cooking or when making a casserole, double the recipe so you can eat one
                            and freeze one for another meal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Eat the rainbow</b>
                        <p>In addition to eating sufficient servings of fruits and vegetables, eating the rainbow is
                            a great way to ensure you're eating a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day.
                            You'll get a broader range of nutrients from natural sources and more health benefits.</p>
